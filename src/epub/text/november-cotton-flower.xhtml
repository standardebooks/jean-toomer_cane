			<h2 epub:type="title">November Cotton Flower</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Boll-weevil’s coming, and the winter’s cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made cotton-stalks look rusty, seasons old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cotton, scarce as any southern snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was vanishing; the branch, so pinched and slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Failed in its function as the autumn rake;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drouth fighting soil had caused the soil to take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All water from the streams; dead birds were found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In wells a hundred feet below the ground⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such was the season when the flower bloomed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old folks were startled, and it soon assumed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Significance. Superstition saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something it had never seen before:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brown eyes that loved without a trace of fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beauty so sudden for that time of year.</span>
