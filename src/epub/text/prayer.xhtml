				<span>My body is opaque to the soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Driven of the spirit, long have I sought to temper it unto the spirit’s longing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But my mind, too, is opaque to the soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A closed lid is my soul’s flesh-eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Spirits of whom my soul is but a little finger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Direct it to the lid of its flesh-eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am weak with much giving.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am weak with the desire to give more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(How strong a thing is the little finger!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So weak that I have confused the body with the soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the body with its little finger.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(How frail is the little finger.)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My voice could not carry to you did you dwell in stars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Spirits of whom my soul is but a little finger⁠ ⁠…</span>
