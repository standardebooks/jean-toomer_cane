				<h2>Song of the Son</h2>
				<p>
					<span>Pour O pour that parting soul in song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O pour it in the sawdust glow of night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the velvet pine-smoke air to-night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let the valley carry it along.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let the valley carry it along.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O land and soil, red soil and sweet-gum tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So scant of grass, so profligate of pines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now just before an epochâ€™s sun declines</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy son, in time, I have returned to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy son, I have in time returned to thee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In time, for though the sun is setting on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A song-lit race of slaves, it has not set;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though late, O soil, it is not too late yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To catch thy plaintive soul, leaving, soon gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaving, to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O Negro slaves, dark purple ripened plums,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Squeezed, and bursting in the pine-wood air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passing, before they stripped the old tree bare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One plum was saved for me, one seed becomes</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>An everlasting song, a singing tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Caroling softly souls of slavery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What they were, and what they are to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Caroling softly souls of slavery.</span>
