    <h2>FOREWORD</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">READING this book, I had the vision of a land, heretofore sunk in
    the mists of muteness, suddenly rising up into the eminence of song.
    Innumerable books have been written about the South; some good books
    have been written in the South. This book <i>is</i> the South. I do not
    mean that <i>Cane</i> covers the South or is the South’s full voice. Merely
    this: a poet has arisen among our American youth who has known how to
    turn the essences and materials of his Southland into the essences and
    materials of literature. A poet has arisen in that land who writes, not
    as a Southerner, not as a rebel against Southerners, not as a Negro,
    not as apologist or priest or critic: who writes as a <i>poet</i>. The
    fashioning of beauty is ever foremost in his inspiration: not forcedly
    but simply, and because these ultimate aspects of his world are to him
    more real than all its specific problems. He has made songs and lovely
    stories of his land ... not of its yesterday, but of its immediate
    life. And that has been enough.</p>

  <p>How rare this is will be clear to those who<span class="pagenum">viii</span> have followed with
    concern the struggle of the South toward literary expression, and the
    particular trial of that portion of its folk whose skin is dark. The
    gifted Negro has been too often thwarted from becoming a poet because
    his world was forever forcing him to recollect that he was a Negro.
    The artist must lose such lesser identities in the great well of life.
    The English poet is not forever protesting and recalling that he is
    English. It is so natural and easy for him to be English that he can
    sing as a man. The French novelist is not forever noting: “This is
    French.” It is so atmospheric for him to be French, that he can devote
    himself to saying: “This is human.” This is an imperative condition for
    the creating of deep art. The whole will and mind of the creator must
    go below the surfaces of race. And this has been an almost impossible
    condition for the American Negro to achieve, forced every moment of his
    life into a specific and superficial plane of consciousness.</p>

  <p>The first negative significance of <i>Cane</i> is that this so natural
    and restrictive state of mind is completely lacking. For Toomer,
    the Southland is not a problem to be solved; it is a field of
    loveliness <span class="pagenum">ix</span>to be sung: the Georgia Negro is not a downtrodden soul
    to be uplifted; he is material for gorgeous painting: the segregated
    self-conscious brown belt of Washington is not a topic to be discussed
    and exposed; it is a subject of beauty and of drama, worthy of creation
    in literary form.</p>

  <p>It seems to me, therefore, that this is a first book in more ways
    than one. It is a harbinger of the South’s literary maturity: of its
    emergence from the obsession put upon its minds by the unending racial
    crisis—an obsession from which writers have made their indirect escape
    through sentimentalism, exoticism, polemic, “problem” fiction, and
    moral melodrama. It marks the dawn of direct and unafraid creation.
    And, as the initial work of a man of twenty-seven, it is the harbinger
    of a literary force of whose incalculable future I believe no reader of
    this book will be in doubt.</p>

  <p>How typical is <i>Cane</i> of the South’s still virgin soil and of its
    pressing seeds! and the book’s chaos of verse, tale, drama, its
    rhythmic rolling shift from lyrism to narrative, from mystery to
    intimate pathos! But read the book through<span class="pagenum">x</span> and you will see a
    complex and significant form take substance from its chaos. Part One
    is the primitive and evanescent black world of Georgia. Part Two is
    the threshing and suffering brown world of Washington, lifted by
    opportunity and contact into the anguish of self-conscious struggle.
    Part Three is Georgia again ... the invasion into this black womb of
    the ferment seed: the neurotic, educated, spiritually stirring Negro.
    As a broad form this is superb, and the very looseness and unexpected
    waves of the book’s parts make <i>Cane</i> still more <i>South</i>, still more of
    an æsthetic equivalent of the land.</p>

  <p>What a land it is! What an Æschylean beauty to its fateful problem!
    Those of you who love our South will find here some of your love. Those
    of you who know it not will perhaps begin to understand what a warm
    splendor is at last at dawn.</p>

  <p>So, in his still sometimes clumsy stride (for<span class="pagenum">xi</span> Toomer is finally a
    poet in prose) the author gives you an inkling of his revelation. An
    individual force, wise enough to drink humbly at this great spring of
    his land ... such is the first impression of Jean Toomer. But beyond
    this wisdom and this power (which shows itself perhaps most splendidly
    in his complete freedom from the sense of persecution), there rises
    a figure more significant: the artist, hard, self-immolating, the
    artist who is not interested in races, whose domain is Life. The book’s
    final Part is no longer “promise”; it is achievement. It is no mere
    dawn: it is a bit of the full morning. These materials ... the ancient
    black man, mute, inaccessible, and yet so mystically close to the new
    tumultuous members of his race, the simple slave Past, the shredding
    Negro Present, the iridescent passionate dream of the To-morrow ...
    are made and measured by a craftsman into an unforgettable music. The
    notes of his counterpoint are particular, the themes are of intimate
    connection with us Americans. But the result is that abstract and
    absolute thing called Art.</p>
